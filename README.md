# 🐍 Snake Game (Java)

A classic **Snake Game** implemented in **Java** — where the player controls a snake to eat food, grow longer, and avoid collisions with the walls or its own tail.

This project demonstrates game logic, real-time keyboard input handling, and simple GUI/console output in Java using basic language features and standard libraries.

## 🎮 About the Game

Snake is one of the most iconic classic games. The goal is simple:

- Control the snake’s movement using arrow keys or WASD
- Eat food to grow longer
- Avoid colliding with walls or your own tail
- Aim for the highest score possible

This implementation provides a foundational Java version of the game suitable for learning object-oriented programming, event handling, and simple animation loops.
